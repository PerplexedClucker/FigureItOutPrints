# FigureItOutPrints
Dropshipping/Affiliate Marketing/3D Print Services Business model 
The projects goal is to create modern homesteads and donate as much of the proceedings as possible, to mental health services and other humanitarian causes. 
I'm someone who suffered minor brain damage as a child. Back then, little was known of the long term effects and they've been drastic. I'm working to help others who might be in a similar situation, as I've struggled with substance abuse, major/persistent depressive disorder, generalized anxiety and other issues I'll discuss later. 
I'm not a programmer, designer, or even someone who knows how to download retro games properly. 
I want to help people. I have limited resources and even more limited skills, but my grandma always said I had a heart of gold and I can't let her down. 
Where do I go from here? I'll have to let you know... For now, I'm building a website on Wix and have a 3D printer, as well as my cousin who's more technologically savvy than I am, but I've got this far, so who knows!
